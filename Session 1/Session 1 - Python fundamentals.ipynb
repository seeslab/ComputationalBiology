    "# Why Python and Python notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is probably the most widely used all-purpose programming language in academia. Although many people will use other languages for specific applications (e.g. R for statistical analysis), the beauty of Python is that it can be used for anything, from analyzing and comparing genome sequences, to training deep neural networks, producing beautiful interactive graphs, creating web apps, or designing an interface to interact with experimental equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this class, Python is useful because there are Python **modules** for all the topics we will be discussing (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, networks, and machine learning). Additionally, Python is intuitive and well designed, so the things that your intuition tells you should work---well, they typically work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, Python allows us to work with **notebooks**. The document you are reading (with an `.ipynb` extension) is a Python notebook. In notebooks, content is organized in **cells**, which may contain text or code. For example, the following cell contains a simple piece of Python code, which can be executed by typing `ctrl+Enter`:"

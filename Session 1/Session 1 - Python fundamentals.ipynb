    "# Why Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is probably the most widely used all-purpose programming language in science. Although many people will use other languages for specific applications (e.g. R for statistical analysis), the beauty of Python is that it can be used for anything, from analyzing and comparing genome sequences, to training deep neural networks, producing beautiful interactive graphs, creating web apps, or designing an interface to interact with experimental equipment. Also outside academia, Python is being used more and more; take a look at these Google Trends:\n",

    "# Why Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is probably the most widely used all-purpose programming language in science. Although many people will use other languages for specific applications (e.g. R for statistical analysis), the beauty of Python is that it can be used for anything, from analyzing and comparing genome sequences, to training deep neural networks, producing beautiful interactive graphs, creating web apps, or designing an interface to interact with experimental equipment. Also outside academia, Python is being used more and more; take a look at these Google Trends:\n",

    "For the purpose of this class, Python is useful because there are Python **modules** for all the topics we will be discussing (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, networks, and machine learning). Additionally, Python is intuitive and well designed, so when your intuition tells you that something should work---well, it typically works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, Python allows us to work with **notebooks**. The document you are reading (with an `.ipynb` extension) is a Python notebook. In notebooks, content is organized in **cells**, which may contain text or code. For example, the following cell contains a simple piece of Python code, which can be executed by selecting it and typing `ctrl+Enter`. Let's try it:"

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that, compared to other programming languages, Python is less structured. For example, as we have seen, you do not need to define variables and can even change the type of a variable. Also, notice that we do not need to specify the end of a line (in `C`, for example, all lines must end with `;`). This is good in some situations but it forces you to be extra-careful with format in others. We will see some examples when we discuss flow control below."

To do this, we will be using `Biopyton`, a comprehensive Python module that allows you to do these and many other things. For a complete tour of `Biopython`, take a look at the [complete tutorial](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html).\n",

Your colleagues Oscar and Maria, from the genomics platform at the hospital, have been able to isolate a viral genome from the patient; this virus is thought to be responsible for the disease. You are expected to identify what the virus is and, thus, provide a diagnosis. You are also expected to compare the virus' genome with the genome of similar viruses to try to understand where the disease came from and how is it different from known diseases. \n",

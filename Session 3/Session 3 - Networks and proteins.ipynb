    "In today's session, we will be working with networks and, in particular, with protein-protein interacion networks, also called *interactomes*. For this, we will be using two different modules. For **network analysis**, we will be using [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/), a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. Some of NetworkX features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data structures for graphs, digraphs, and multigraphs\n",
    "- Many standard graph algorithms\n",
    "- Network structure and analysis measures\n",
    "- Generators for classic graphs, random graphs, and synthetic networks\n",
    "- Nodes can be \"anything\" (e.g., text, images, XML records)\n",
    "- Edges can hold arbitrary data (e.g., weights, time-series)\n",
    "\n",
    "For studying **interactomes**, we will be getting data from the [BioGrid database](https://thebiogrid.org/), an interaction repository with data compiled through comprehensive curation efforts. We could, of course, go to BioGrid and gather data manually. But, as usual, if we want to do that repeteadly, we'd rather write some code to do it for us. To automate the task of getting data from BioGrid we will be using the [Orange Bioinformatics](https://pythonhosted.org/Orange-Bioinformatics/index.html) package, wich provides functionality for some elementary tasks in bioinformatics, including getting protein-protein interaction data.\n",

For example, each `Graph()` instance has an **attribute** `name` that stores a label for the whole graph.

In general, when dealing with biological data we do *not* want to build networks by adding nodes and edges one by one, but rather get data from some database. Here, we will see how to get data from the [BioGrid](https://thebiogrid.org/) protein interaction database. To automate this task, we will be using the [Orange Bioinformatics](https://pythonhosted.org/Orange-Bioinformatics/) Python module.

    "# Reminder of flux balance analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a mathematical and computational technique for estimating metabolic fluxes at a systems level. As you saw in the theory class, the general idea of the method is shown in the following illustration:\n",
    "\n",
    "![FBA](Media/fba.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a given reconstruction of a metabolic network, we start by assuming that all fluxes $(v_1, v_2,...)$ (corresponding to reactions 1, 2,...) are possible, so we start with an *unconstrained solution space*. Then, we impose that, if metabolism is working in the steady state, no metabolite can accumulate or get depleated. This translates into a set of linear constraints on the values of the fluxes, and therefore defines an *allowable solution space*. Third and last, among all solutions in the allowable solution space, we choose the one that is optimal in some way. Typically, we choose the solution that results in maximum biomass production for the metabolic network, because we assume that this solution is evolutionarily favourable.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`COBRApy`](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/) is a Python implementation of the COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis Toolbox [for MATLAB](https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/), a software suite for quantitative prediction of cellular and multicellular biochemical networks with constraint-based modelling. As we will see in today's session, it can be used for modeling metabolic fluxes and simulating gene knockouts, among other things."
